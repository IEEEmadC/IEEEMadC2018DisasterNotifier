# IEEEMadC2018DisasterNotifier
Our application for IEEEMadC 2018!

# Introduction

We develop an application that will alert citizens for natural disasters occurring near them and guide them to the nearest safe area using maps.

It will also allow citizens to report a disaster that is taking place near them, so authorities and other citizens are immediately informed.

The application will be general, and can be used in all kinds of natural disasters (floods, earthquakes, typhoons, cyclones, volcanic eruptions, tsunami, etc).

We decided to build this application after the deadly fire in Mati (Attica, Greece), where 99 people died because citizens were not informed in time, they were not heading in the right direction, and the authorities were late to be informed.
